**INSTRUCTIONS FOR CHANGING QUESTIONS IN FILE**-------------------------------------------------------------
2 examples: "normalMode.txt" and "easyMode.txt"  -[you can change the file in MissionBase.cpp if you want]  :)  
or just edit the normlaMode file with the following rules:
each question containst:
	1.a given code ID  [ DIV CLC PRM POW REM SQR MUL  ]
	2.question text (with %d as variable) 
	3.number of variables
	4.variables themselves (1 per line)

	(explanation to what is every code is already waiting in the normalMode.txt)

	**	in CLC  (custom calculator question) the text is generated on the fly,
	** 	and the variable (20 in the example) is hardness of the random number (about 20 should be hardest..)
	**  (will random numbers 1-20..1-40..1-80 in different places)

you can also remove some of the questions completely if you want, make sure to remove all the lines up until the next question CODE ID (as seen is easyMode.txt)
